    "After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the core features of the LangChain framework, including prompt templates, chains, and agents, relative to enhancing LLM customization and output relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore LangChain's modular approach, which supports dynamic adjustments to prompts and models without extensive code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhance LLM applications by integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques with LangChain. You'll learn how integrating RAG enables greater accuracy and delivers improved contextually-aware responses.\n"
